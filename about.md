My name is Paul Myjavec,

I'm original from Wollongong, Australia but my love for travel currently has me living in Amsterdam, Netherlands, hoping to see
as much of Europe as possible.

I'm very interested in Reading, Board Sports (Skating, Surfing, Snowboarding) and practising Yoga.

I'd rather travel by bike.

Happiest in the ocean.
