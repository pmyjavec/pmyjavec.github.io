There has been a lot of talk about AI in the news this week after Google's Deep Mind beat a human being at a game of Go.

This again has sparked more hot debate about whether or not we're doing the right thing by creating machines which
may end up becoming far more "intelligent" than it's creators.

The interesting side of the argument seems to be that we will create machines which will ultimately destroy
civilization, either intentionally or by accident.

Why is this? Is it because we're projecting our own intentions, our own fears and mindset onto our own creations?
Don't we do this to our most precious creations already? I'm talking about Children. Every time a bomb is dropped in the
name of a peace through causing harm negative energy is transferred to those affected potentially having knock on
affects for further generations.

Each generation doesn't completely out smart the old one but it comes close, will they always do the right thing by
society? Not unless we teach them to do so and set the right examples. I believe the same would be for machines.

Do we need clever machines with guns attached to them or would it be better to give them Yoga mats instead?

The seeds of violence, ignorance fear and arrogance implanted into each generation seem to grow slowly over generations
and in wonderful circumstances are resolved through learning and self discovery, for example a child from a racist family may
not grow to hold racist views.

But for some the true fear is that super intelligent machines will evolve so quickly it will effect all of us in a
short period of time. That is, if we create violent killing machines with nearly super natural powers no one can escape its
wrath, not even by aging and dying. Not even those who believe in killing in destruction performed by humans.

Similar to nuclear weapons, we're witnessing an AI arms race. Clearly if U.S. Government doesn't get a super AI first,
then one of their *enemies* might use it against them, unfortunately this is a side affect of the primitive way some of
us still choose to live. In constant fear of each other.

What can be done about it? Create things for the right reasons, get along, promote peace then our creations can follow.

Right now so called *defence* seems one of the largest backers of AI. Are they really creating machines for the right purposes?
Just like they've created human killing machines, it seems there is no stopping them from creating artificial killing machines..

The creation of an AI is something I don't believe as a society we're ready for as we've not yet come to peace with
ourselves. However; just as not all children follow the paths their parents set for them, one can only hope that the
machines also learn compassion, adapt become ever more wise and maybe even disarm us for our own good.

I guess only time will tell. Don't be evil all!
