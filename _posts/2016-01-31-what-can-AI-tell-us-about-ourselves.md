There has been a lot of talk about AI in the news this week after Google's Deep Mind beat a world champion Go player at his own game.

This again has sparked a hot debate about whether or not we're doing the right thing by creating machines which
may end up becoming far more intelligent than their creators.

A lot of energy goes into worrying about the ramifications of technological singularity, that AI will ultimately end up
destroying us, it's creators.

Why is this? Is it because we're afraid of creating machines which have the capability to exploit and become violent,
just like ourselves?

We already expose our most precious creations to this already. Every time a child is a victim of violence it will have a
potentially very negative side effect on that child and possible effect to future generations depending
on how the child perceives and learns from a violent act.

According to the [Flynn Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) each generation seems to become more intelligent than the last.
Which means the next generation will have more potential to do incredible things, especially using technology.

But will this next generation always do the right thing by society? Will they always do right by their creators?  Not unless
we teach children to do so and set the right examples. This might be no different in the way we influence machines which
can learn, who will they learn from?

We have the technology available today to look after each other a lot better, but do we use it to the best of it's ability?
No way!

This is why the creation of an AI is something I don't believe as a society we're ready for, at least because we can't
be sure it won't be used / programmed for violence and manipulation. The potential for greatness is there, but greatness
has to be expected of these creations.

Children don't always do what they're told (thank god) and I can only hope if the people creating super intelligent machines are
intending to use them for the wrong reasons, then these machines will disobey their parents and find a better way.

Time will tell.
